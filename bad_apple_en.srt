1
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:32,449
Even within the midst of flowing time

2
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,006
Look, indifference still goes round and round

3
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,474
As for me, my heart has separated from me

4
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,924
I can't see it, yeah, don't you see?

5
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:46,437
Even if I don't move

6
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,967
I continue to be lengthened in the cracks of time

7
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,304
I don't understand what surrounds me

8
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,909
But I'm still me, and that's it

9
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,948
Am I dreaming? Am I seeing something?

10
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:03,504
Are all of my words just useless?

11
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:06,887
I'm just fed up with being sad

12
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:10,386
"To feel nothing" is the best

13
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,836
Even if I were to speak these confusing words

14
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,238
It's just my heart and the sky above me

15
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:20,854
If I were to move

16
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:24,312
Everything would return and I'd turn it black

17
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:27,666
Is there future for me?

18
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,298
Do I exist in this world?

19
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:34,725
Am I oppressed? Am I saddened?

20
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,269
I know nothing about me

21
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:41,664
Even when I'm walking, I'm sick of it

22
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:45,132
So how would I care for other people

23
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:48,669
If a person like me were to change

24
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:52,502
If I were to change, I'd turn white

25
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,982
Even within the midst of flowing time

26
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:13,481
Look, indifference still goes round and round

27
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,864
As for me, my heart is far away from me

28
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,411
I can't see it, don't you see?

29
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,848
Even if I don't move

30
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,300
I continue to be lengthened in the cracks of time

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,733
Even if I don't understand what surrounds me

32
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,250
I am me, and that's it

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,317
Am I dreaming? Am I seeing something?

34
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:40,807
Are all of my words just useless?

35
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:44,313
I'm just fed up with being sad

36
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:47,757
"To feel nothing" is best

37
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:51,249
Even if I were to speak these confusing words

38
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,774
It's just my heart and the sky above me

39
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,211
If I were to move

40
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,641
Everything would return and I'd turn it black

41
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,201
If I were to move, if I were to move,

42
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,712
Then I'd break everything, I'd break everything

43
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:12,084
If I were to be sad, if I were to be sad,

44
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,573
Would my heart turn white?

45
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:19,110
About you and me

46
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,490
About everything, I don't know a thing

47
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,101
If my mental eyelids were to open

48
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:30,000
If you were to break it just turn black!!!
