1
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:32,449
Ever on and on I continue circling

2
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,006
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

3
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,474
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing

4
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,924
And suddenly I see that I can't break free — I'm

5
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:46,437
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity

6
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,967
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

7
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,304
To tell me who I am, who I was — Uncertainty

8
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,909
Enveloping my mind till I can't break free — And

9
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,948
Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

10
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:03,504
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

11
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:06,887
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside

12
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:10,386
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night

13
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,836
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go

14
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,238
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know

15
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:20,854
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back

16
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:24,312
Because everything will change and it all will fade to black

17
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:27,666
Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?

18
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,298
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?

19
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:34,725
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?

20
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,269
I've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?

21
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:41,664
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can

22
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:45,132
All the people that I see I will never understand

23
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:48,669
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light

24
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:52,502
Then I'll never be the same and it all will fade to white

25
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,982
Ever on and on I continue circling

26
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:13,481
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

27
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,864
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing

28
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,411
And suddenly I see that I can't break free — I'm

29
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:23,832
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity

30
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:27,300
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,733
To tell me who I am, who I was — Uncertainty

32
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,250
Enveloping my mind till I can't break free — And

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,317
Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

34
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:40,807
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

35
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:44,313
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside

36
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:47,757
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night

37
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:51,249
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go

38
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,774
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know

39
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,211
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back

40
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,641
Because everything will change and it all will fade to black

41
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,201
If I make another move, if I take another step

42
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,712
Then it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me left

43
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:12,084
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night

44
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,573
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?

45
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:19,110
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?

46
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,490
I've forgotten how too see; I've forgotten if I can

47
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,101
If I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back

48
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:30,000
'Cause I'd throw it all away and it all would fade to black!!!
